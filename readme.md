#Bring It Back
*by Hapax (2015)*
(http://github.com/Hapaxia)

C++11 required and [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org) 2 (2.2 was used) is required.

This game was [my entry](http://sfmlgamejam.com/jams/1/games/3) for the [SFML Game Jam 4](http://sfmlgamejam.com/jams) (May 2015).
It was compiled for Windows for the submission.
All sounds and graphics are original resources.

Uses [Hx library](http://github.com/Hapaxia/Hx).
At time of uploading, the Github version of Hx is not up-to-date. Features used but missing from the Github version are:
* Plinth/SFML/Anchor (returns object boundaries)
* Depot/SFML/ResourceManagerBasic (stores fonts, graphics, and sounds)
* Kairos/Timestep (only the "lite" version is present on Github)

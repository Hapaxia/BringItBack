C++11 and [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org) 2 (2.2 was used) is required. Also uses [Hx library](http://github.com/Hapaxia/Hx).

This game was [my entry](http://sfmlgamejam.com/jams/1/games/3) for the [SFML Game Jam 4](http://sfmlgamejam.com/jams) (May 2015).
It was compiled for Windows for the submission.
All sounds and graphics are original resources.
